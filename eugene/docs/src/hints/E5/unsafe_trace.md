#### Hints

##### [Type change requiring table rewrite](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E5/)
ID: `E5`

A column was changed to a data type that isn't binary compatible. This causes a full table rewrite while holding a lock that prevents all other use of the table. A safer way is: Add a new column, update it in batches, and drop the old column.

The column `price` in the table `public.prices` was changed from type `int4` to `int8`. This requires an `AccessExclusiveLock` that will block all other transactions from using the table while it is being rewritten.
##### [Creating a new index on an existing table](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E6/)
ID: `E6`

A new index was created on an existing table without the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created. A safer way is: Run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` instead of `CREATE INDEX`.

A new index was created on the table `public.prices`. The index was created non-concurrently, which blocks all writes to the table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes.
##### [Rewrote table or index while holding dangerous lock](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E10/)
ID: `E10`

A table or index was rewritten while holding a lock that blocks many operations. This blocks many operations on the table or index while the rewrite is in progress. A safer way is: Build a new table or index, write to both, then swap them.

The Table `public.prices` was rewritten while holding `AccessExclusiveLock` on the Table `public.prices`. This blocks `SELECT`, `FOR UPDATE`, `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE`, `FOR KEY SHARE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE` while the rewrite is in progress.
