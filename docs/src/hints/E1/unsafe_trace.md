### Hints

##### Validating table with a new constraint

ID: `E1`

A new constraint was added and it is already `VALID`. This blocks all table access until all rows are validated. A safer way is: Add the constraint as `NOT VALID` and validate it with `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` later.

A new constraint `name_not_null` of type `CHECK` was added to the table `public.authors` as `VALID`. Constraints that are `NOT VALID` can be made `VALID` by `ALTER TABLE public.authors VALIDATE CONSTRAINT name_not_null` which takes a lesser lock.
