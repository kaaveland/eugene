##### Validating table with a new `NOT NULL` column

ID: `E2`

A column was changed from `NULL` to `NOT NULL`. This blocks all table access until all rows are validated. A safer way is: Add a `CHECK` constraint as `NOT VALID`, validate it later, then make the column `NOT NULL`.

Statement takes `AccessExclusiveLock` on `public.authors` by setting `name` to `NOT NULL` blocking reads until all rows are validated
