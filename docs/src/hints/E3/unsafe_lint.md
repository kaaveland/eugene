### Statement number 1
#### SQL
```sql
create table authors (
    id integer generated always as identity primary key,
    name text not null,
    meta json
)
```
#### Lints

##### Add a new JSON column

ID: `E3`

A new column of type `json` was added to a table. This breaks `SELECT DISTINCT` queries or other operations that need equality checks on the column. A safer way is: Use the `jsonb` type instead, it supports all use-cases of `json` and is more robust and compact.

Created column `meta` with type `json`. The `json` type does not support equality and should not be used, use `jsonb` instead.
