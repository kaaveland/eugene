##### [Adding a `SERIAL` or `GENERATED ... STORED` column](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E11/)

ID: `E11`

A new column was added with a `SERIAL` or `GENERATED` type. This blocks all table access until the table is rewritten. A safer way is: Can not be done without a table rewrite.

Added column `id` with type that will force table rewrite  in `.prices`. `serial` types and `GENERATED ALWAYS as ... STORED` columns require a full table rewrite with `AccessExclusiveLock`.
