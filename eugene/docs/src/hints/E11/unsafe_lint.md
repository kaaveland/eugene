  2. By passing `--ignore E123` on the command line.

#### Triggered rules

##### `E11`: [Adding a `SERIAL` or `GENERATED ... STORED` column](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E11/)

Added column `id` with type that will force table rewrite  in `.prices`. `serial` types and `GENERATED ALWAYS as ... STORED` columns require a full table rewrite with `AccessExclusiveLock`.
