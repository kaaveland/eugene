# Eugene 🔒 trace report of `alter_column_not_null.sql`

This is a human readable lock tracing and migration report generated by [eugene](https://github.com/kaaveland/eugene) to assist you in writing safer database migration scripts.

Here are some tips for reading it:
- A lock is called **dangerous** ❌ if it will cause concurrent queries to **wait** for the migration to complete.
- You read that right, once a lock is acquired, it is only released at the end of the script.
- Eugene will tell you what kinds of queries **dangerous** locks would block in a summary
- **Hints** can sometimes help you avoid dangerous locks, or hold them for a shorter time
- It is hard to avoid dangerous locks, but we should minimize time spent while holding them
- Sometimes seemingly fast migration scripts cause long outages because of lock queues, [here is an example scenario](https://kaveland.no/careful-with-that-lock-eugene.html)

There is a summary section for the entire script at the start of the report and then a section for each statement in the script, that goes over the state of the database at the time the script was executed, as well as effects or hints specific to that particular statement

## Overall Summary

Started at | Total duration (ms) | Number of dangerous locks
---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------
2021-01-01T01:00:00+01:00 | 10 | 1 ❌

### All locks found

Schema | Object | Mode | Relkind | OID | Safe | Duration held (ms)
------ | ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | ---- | ------------------
`public` | `books` | `AccessExclusiveLock` | Table | 1 | ❌ | 10

### Dangerous locks found

- `AccessExclusiveLock` would block the following operations on `public.books`:
  + `SELECT`
  + `FOR UPDATE`
  + `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`
  + `FOR SHARE`
  + `FOR KEY SHARE`
  + `UPDATE`
  + `DELETE`
  + `INSERT`
  + `MERGE`

## Statement number 1 for 10 ms

### SQL

```sql
alter table books alter column title set not null;
```

### Locks at start

No locks held at the start of this statement.

### New locks taken

Schema | Object | Mode | Relkind | OID | Safe
------ | ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | ----
`public` | `books` | `AccessExclusiveLock` | Table | 1 | ❌

### Hints

#### Validating table with a new `NOT NULL` column

ID: `make_column_not_nullable_with_lock`

The column `title` in the table `public.books` was changed to `NOT NULL`. The statement blocks until all rows in the table are validated to be `NOT NULL`, unless a `CHECK (title IS NOT NULL)` constraint exists, in which case it is safe. Splitting this kind of change into 3 steps can make it safer:

 1. Add a `CHECK (title IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;` constraint.
2. Validate the constraint in a later transaction, with `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`.
3. Make the column `NOT NULL`
