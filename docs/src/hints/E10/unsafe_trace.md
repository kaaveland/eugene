### Hints

##### Creating a new index on an existing table

ID: `E6`

A new index was created on an existing table without the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created. A safer way is: Run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` instead of `CREATE INDEX`.

A new index was created on the table `public.prices`. The index was created non-concurrently, which blocks all writes to the table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes.

##### Rewrote table or index while holding dangerous lock

ID: `E10`

A table or index was rewritten while holding a lock that blocks many operations. This blocks many operations on the table or index while the rewrite is in progress. A safer way is: Build a new table or index, write to both, then swap them.

The Table `public.prices` was rewritten while holding `AccessExclusiveLock` on the Table `public.authors`. This blocks `SELECT`, `FOR UPDATE`, `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE`, `FOR KEY SHARE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE` while the rewrite is in progress.
