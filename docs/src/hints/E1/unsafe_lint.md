##### Validating table with a new constraint

ID: `E1`

A new constraint was added and it is already `VALID`. This blocks all table access until all rows are validated. A safer way is: Add the constraint as `NOT VALID` and validate it with `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` later.

Statement takes `AccessExclusiveLock` on `public.authors`, blocking reads until constraint `name_not_null` is validated.
