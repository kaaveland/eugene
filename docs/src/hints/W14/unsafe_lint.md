##### [Adding a primary key using an index](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/W14/)

ID: `W14`

A primary key was added using an index on the table. This can cause postgres to alter the index columns to be `NOT NULL`. A safer way is: Make sure that all the columns in the index are already `NOT NULL`.

New primary key constraint using index on `public.authors`, may cause postgres to `SET NOT NULL` on columns in the index. This lint may be a false positive if the columns are already `NOT NULL`, ignore it by commenting the statement with `-- eugene: ignore: W14`.
