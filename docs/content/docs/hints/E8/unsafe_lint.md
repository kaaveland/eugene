### Lints

##### Creating a new exclusion constraint

ID: `E8`

Found a new exclusion constraint. This blocks all reads and writes to the table while the constraint index is being created. A safer way is: There is no safe way to add an exclusion constraint to an existing table.

Statement takes `AccessExclusiveLock` on `public.authors`, blocking reads and writes until constraint `authors_name_excl` is validated and has created index
