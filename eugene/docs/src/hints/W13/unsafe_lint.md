## ❌ Eugene lint report

Script name: `examples/W13/bad/1.sql`

This is a human readable SQL lint report generated by [eugene](https://github.com/kaaveland/eugene).
Keep in mind that lint rules can be ignored in the following two ways:

  1. By appending comment directives like `-- eugene: ignore E123` to the SQL statement.
  2. By passing `--ignore E123` on the command line.

### ❌ Statement number 1

```sql
-- 1.sql
create type document_type
    as enum ('invoice', 'receipt', 'other')
```

#### Triggered rules

##### `W13`: [Creating an enum](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/W13/)

Created enum `document_type`. Enumerated types are not recommended for use in new applications. Consider using a foreign key to a lookup table instead..

### ✅ Statement number 2

```sql
create table document (
    id int generated always as identity
        primary key,
    type document_type
)
```
