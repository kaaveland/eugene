##### [Creating a new unique constraint](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E7/)

ID: `E7`

Adding a new unique constraint implicitly creates index. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created and validated. A safer way is: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, then add the constraint using the index.

New constraint unique_name creates implicit index on `public.authors`, blocking writes until index is created and validated.
