```sql
create table authors(name text)
```

alter table authors add constraint authors_name_pkey primary key using index authors_name_key
```

### Lints

##### Taking dangerous lock without timeout

ID: `E9`

A lock that would block many common operations was taken without a timeout. This can block all other operations on the table indefinitely if any other transaction holds a conflicting lock while `idle in transaction` or `active`. A safer way is: Run `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2s';` before the statement and retry the migration if necessary.

Statement takes lock on `public.authors`, but does not set a lock timeout

##### Adding a primary key using an index

ID: `W14`

A primary key was added using an index on the table. This can cause postgres to alter the index columns to be `NOT NULL`. A safer way is: Make sure that all the columns in the index are already `NOT NULL`.

New primary key constraint using index on `public.authors`, may cause postgres to `SET NOT NULL` on columns in the index. This lint may be a false positive if the columns are already `NOT NULL`, ignore it by commenting the statement with `-- eugene: ignore: W14`
