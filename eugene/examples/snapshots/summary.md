## ✅ Eugene trace report

Script name: `examples/E10/bad/1.sql`

This is a human-readable lock tracing and migration report generated by [eugene](https://github.com/kaaveland/eugene).
It can assist you in writing safer database migration scripts.

Here are some tips for reading it:

- A lock is called **dangerous** ❌ if it will cause concurrent queries to **wait** for the migration to complete
- You read that right, once a lock is acquired, it is only released at the end of the script
- Eugene will tell you what kinds of queries **dangerous** locks would block in a summary
- **Hints** can sometimes help you avoid dangerous locks, or hold them for a shorter time
- It is hard to avoid dangerous locks, but we should minimize time spent while holding them
- Sometimes seemingly fast migration scripts cause long outages because of lock queues,
  [here is an example scenario](https://kaveland.no/careful-with-that-lock-eugene.html)

There is a summary section for the entire script at the start of the report
and then a section for each statement in the script, that goes over the state of the database
at the time the script was executed, as well as effects or hints specific to that particular
statement.

### Overall Summary

| Started at | Total duration (ms) | Number of dangerous locks |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|

#### Triggered rules

##### `E6`: [Creating a new index on an existing table](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E6/)

A new index was created on the table `public.prices`. The index was created non-concurrently, which blocks all writes to the table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes.

##### `E10`: [Rewrote table or index while holding dangerous lock](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E10/)

The Table `public.prices` was rewritten while holding `AccessExclusiveLock` on the Table `public.authors`. This blocks `SELECT`, `FOR UPDATE`, `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE`, `FOR KEY SHARE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE` while the rewrite is in progress.
