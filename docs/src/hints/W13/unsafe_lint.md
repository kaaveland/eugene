### Statement number 1
#### SQL
```sql
create type document_type as enum ('invoice', 'receipt', 'other')
```
#### Lints

##### Creating an enum

ID: `W13`

A new enum was created. Removing values from an enum requires difficult migrations, and associating more data with an enum value is difficult. A safer way is: Use a foreign key to a lookup table instead.

Created enum `document_type`. Enumerated types are not recommended for use in new applications. Consider using a foreign key to a lookup table instead..
### Statement number 2
#### SQL
```sql
create table document (id int generated always as identity primary key, type document_type)
```
No checks matched for this statement. ✅
