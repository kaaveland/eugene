##### [Multiple `ALTER TABLE` statements where one will do](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/W12/)

ID: `W12`

Multiple `ALTER TABLE` statements targets the same table. If the statements require table scans, there will be more scans than necessary. A safer way is: Combine the statements into one, separating the action with commas.

Multiple `ALTER TABLE` statements on `public.authors`. Combine them into a single statement to avoid scanning the table multiple times..
