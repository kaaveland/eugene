##### Creating a new index on an existing table

ID: `E6`

A new index was created on an existing table without the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created. A safer way is: Run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` instead of `CREATE INDEX`.

Statement takes `ShareLock` on `public.authors`, blocking writes while creating index `public.authors_name_idx`
