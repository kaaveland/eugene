# Eugene üîí trace report of `widen_type.sql`

This is a human readable lock tracing and migration report generated by [eugene](https://github.com/kaaveland/eugene) to assist you in writing safer database migration scripts.

Here are some tips for reading it:
- A lock is called **dangerous** ‚ùå if it will cause concurrent queries to **wait** for the migration to complete
- You read that right, once a lock is acquired, it is only released at the end of the script
- Eugene will tell you what kinds of queries **dangerous** locks would block in a summary
- **Hints** can sometimes help you avoid dangerous locks, or hold them for a shorter time
- It is hard to avoid dangerous locks, but we should minimize time spent while holding them
- Sometimes seemingly fast migration scripts cause long outages because of lock queues, [here is an example scenario](https://kaveland.no/careful-with-that-lock-eugene.html)

There is a summary section for the entire script at the start of the report and then a section for each statement in the script, that goes over the state of the database at the time the script was executed, as well as effects or hints specific to that particular statement

### Hints

#### Type change requiring table rewrite

ID: `E5`

A column was changed to a data type that isn't binary compatible. This causes a full table rewrite while holding a lock that prevents all other use of the table. A safer way is: Add a new column, update it in batches, and drop the old column.

The column `price` in the table `public.books` was changed from type `int4` to `int8`. This requires an `AccessExclusiveLock` that will block all other transactions from using the table while it is being rewritten.

#### Creating a new index on an existing table

ID: `E6`

A new index was created on an existing table without the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created. A safer way is: Run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` instead of `CREATE INDEX`.

A new index was created on the table `public.books`. The index `pg_toast.pg_toast_16421_index` was created non-concurrently, which blocks all writes to the table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes.

#### Rewrote table or index while holding dangerous lock

ID: `E10`

A table or index was rewritten while holding a lock that blocks many operations. This blocks many operations on the table or index while the rewrite is in progress. A safer way is: Build a new table or index, write to both, then swap them.

The Table `public.books` was rewritten while holding `AccessExclusiveLock` on the Table `public.books`. This blocks `SELECT`, `FOR UPDATE`, `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE`, `FOR KEY SHARE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE` while the rewrite is in progress.
