#### Hints

##### [Running more statements after taking `AccessExclusiveLock`](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E4/)
ID: `E4`

A transaction that holds an `AccessExclusiveLock` started a new statement. This blocks all access to the table for the duration of this statement. A safer way is: Run this statement in a new transaction.

The statement is running while holding an `AccessExclusiveLock` on the Table `public.authors`, blocking all other transactions from accessing it.
