# Eugene üîí trace report of `add_check_constraint.sql`

This is a human readable lock tracing and migration report generated by [eugene](https://github.com/kaaveland/eugene) to assist you in writing safer database migration scripts.

Here are some tips for reading it:
- A lock is called **dangerous** ‚ùå if it will cause concurrent queries to **wait** for the migration to complete.
- You read that right, once a lock is acquired, it is only released at the end of the script.
- Eugene will tell you what kinds of queries **dangerous** locks would block in a summary
- **Hints** can sometimes help you avoid dangerous locks, or hold them for a shorter time
- It is hard to avoid dangerous locks, but we should minimize time spent while holding them
- Sometimes seemingly fast migration scripts cause long outages because of lock queues, [here is an example scenario](https://kaveland.no/careful-with-that-lock-eugene.html)

There is a summary section for the entire script at the start of the report and then a section for each statement in the script, that goes over the state of the database at the time the script was executed, as well as effects or hints specific to that particular statement

### All locks found

Schema | Object | Mode | Relkind | OID | Safe | Duration held (ms)
------ | ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | ---- | ------------------
`public` | `books` | `AccessExclusiveLock` | Table | 1 | ‚ùå | 20
`public` | `books` | `ShareUpdateExclusiveLock` | Table | 1 | ‚úÖ | 10

### Dangerous locks found

- `AccessExclusiveLock` would block the following operations on `public.books`:

  + `FOR SHARE`
  + `FOR KEY SHARE`
  + `UPDATE`
  + `DELETE`

alter table books add constraint check_title_not_null check (title is not null) not valid;
```

### Locks at start

No locks held at the start of this statement.

### New locks taken

------ | ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | ----
`public` | `books` | `AccessExclusiveLock` | Table | 1 | ‚ùå

## Statement number 2 for 10 ms

### SQL

```sql
alter table books validate constraint check_title_not_null;
```

### Locks at start

Schema | Object | Mode | Relkind | OID | Safe
------ | ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | ----
`public` | `books` | `AccessExclusiveLock` | Table | 1 | ‚ùå

### New locks taken

Schema | Object | Mode | Relkind | OID | Safe

`public` | `books` | `ShareUpdateExclusiveLock` | Table | 1 | ‚úÖ

### Hints

#### Running more statements after taking `AccessExclusiveLock`

ID: `holding_access_exclusive`

The statement is running while holding an `AccessExclusiveLock` on the Table `public.books`, blocking all other transactions from accessing it. Once holding `AccessExclusiveLock` we should immediately commit the transaction. Any extra steps necessary are better done in a separate transaction.
