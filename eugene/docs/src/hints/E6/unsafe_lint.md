Keep in mind that lint rules can be ignored in the following two ways:

  1. By appending comment directives like `-- eugene: ignore E123` to the SQL statement.
  2. By passing `--ignore E123` on the command line.

create table authors (
    id integer generated always as identity
        primary key,
    name text not null
)
```
