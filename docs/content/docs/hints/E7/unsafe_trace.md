### Hints

##### Creating a new index on an existing table

ID: `E6`

A new index was created on an existing table without the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created. A safer way is: Run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` instead of `CREATE INDEX`.

A new index was created on the table `public.authors`. The index `public.unique_name` was created non-concurrently, which blocks all writes to the table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes.

##### Creating a new unique constraint

ID: `E7`

Found a new unique constraint and a new index. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created and validated. A safer way is: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, then add the constraint using the index.

A new unique constraint `unique_name` was added to the table `public.authors`. This constraint creates a unique index on the table, and blocks all writes. Consider creating the index concurrently in a separate transaction, then adding the unique constraint by using the index: `ALTER TABLE public.authors ADD CONSTRAINT unique_name UNIQUE USING INDEX public.unique_name;`
