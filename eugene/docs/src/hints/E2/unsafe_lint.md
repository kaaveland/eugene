This is a human readable SQL lint report generated by [eugene](https://github.com/kaaveland/eugene).
Keep in mind that lint rules can be ignored in the following two ways:

  1. By appending comment directives like `-- eugene: ignore E123` to the SQL statement.
  2. By passing `--ignore E123` on the command line.

create table authors(
    id integer generated always as identity
        primary key,
    name text
)
```
