eugene is a tool for writing safer schema changes for PostgreSQL

eugene can run your migration scripts and detect which locks that is taken by each
individual SQL statement and summarize which operations that conflict with those
locks, in other words what the script must wait for and what
concurrent transactions that would be blocked.
