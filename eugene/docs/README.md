# Introduction

Refer to the project README one level up for general information about 
the project, including how to build the documentation. If you've run
`cargo test` in there, you should be able to work on the documentation
using `mdbook serve` in this directory.

## Important: Some files are generated

**`src/SUMMARY.md` is generated by the tests**. To change it, go to
the root project and find `src/doc_summary.md.hbs`. This is a 
handlebars template that is rendered from 
`src/render_doc_snapshots.rs`.

**Everything under `src/hints` is generated by the tests**, so if you 
change anything, it will be lost once you run the tests again. Fix
the templates in the `src/render_doc_snapshots.rs` file in the root
project instead. The same caveat applies to `src/shell_output`.
