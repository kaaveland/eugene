#### Taking dangerous lock without timeout

ID: `E9`

A lock that would block many common operations was taken without a timeout. This can block all other operations on the table indefinitely if any other transaction holds a conflicting lock while `idle in transaction` or `active`. A safer way is: Run `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2s';` before the statement and retry the migration if necessary.

Statement takes lock on `public.authors`, but does not set a lock timeout
