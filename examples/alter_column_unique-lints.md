# Eugene üîí lint report of `examples/alter_column_unique.sql`

This is a human readable SQL script safety report generated by [eugene](https://github.com/kaaveland/eugene). Keep in mind that lints can be ignored by adding a `-- eugene: ignore E123` comment to the SQL statement or by passing --ignore E123 on the command line.

The migration script did not pass all the checks ‚ùå

## Statement number 1

### SQL

```sql
alter table books add constraint unique_title unique(title)
```

### Lints

#### Taking dangerous lock without timeout

ID: `E9`

A lock that would block many common operations was taken without a timeout. This can block all other operations on the table indefinitely if any other transaction holds a conflicting lock while `idle in transaction` or `active`. A safer way is: Run `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2s';` before the statement and retry the migration if necessary.

Statement takes lock on `public.books`, but does not set a lock timeout

#### Creating a new unique constraint

ID: `E7`

Found a new unique constraint and a new index. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created and validated. A safer way is: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, then add the constraint using the index.

New constraint unique_title creates implicit index on `public.books`, blocking writes until index is created and validated
