#### Hints

##### [Creating a new index on an existing table](https://kaveland.no/eugene/hints/E6/)
ID: `E6`

A new index was created on an existing table without the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created. A safer way is: Run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` instead of `CREATE INDEX`.

A new index was created on the table `public.authors`. The index `public.authors_name_idx` was created non-concurrently, which blocks all writes to the table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes.
