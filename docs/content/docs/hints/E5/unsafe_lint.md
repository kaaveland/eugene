##### Type change requiring table rewrite

ID: `E5`

A column was changed to a data type that isn't binary compatible. This causes a full table rewrite while holding a lock that prevents all other use of the table. A safer way is: Add a new column, update it in batches, and drop the old column.

Changed type of column `price` to `pg_catalog.int8` in `.prices`. This operation requires a full table rewrite with `AccessExclusiveLock` if `pg_catalog.int8` is not binary compatible with the previous type of `price`. Prefer adding a new column with the new type, then dropping/renaming.
