### Hints

##### Creating a new index on an existing table

ID: `E6`

A new index was created on an existing table without the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword. This blocks all writes to the table while the index is being created. A safer way is: Run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` instead of `CREATE INDEX`.

A new index was created on the table `public.authors`. The index `public.authors_name_excl` was created non-concurrently, which blocks all writes to the table. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid blocking writes.

##### Creating a new exclusion constraint

ID: `E8`

Found a new exclusion constraint. This blocks all reads and writes to the table while the constraint index is being created. A safer way is: There is no safe way to add an exclusion constraint to an existing table.

A new exclusion constraint `authors_name_excl` was added to the table `public.authors`. There is no safe way to add an exclusion constraint to an existing table. This constraint creates an index on the table, and blocks all reads and writes.
